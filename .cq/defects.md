- headline: Partial amnezia config emits zeroed h1..h4 and would silently misconfigure obfuscation
- description: "Filed by the T8 implement-review panel (opus), file-and-defer. internal/device/device.go writeAmnezia() emits ALL nine amnezia UAPI keys whenever ANY single field is non-zero. config.validate()/Amnezia.validate() enforce only the jmin<=jmax ordering, not an all-or-nothing / non-zero-magic-header invariant. So a partial amnezia block (e.g. jc/jmin/jmax set but s1/s2/h1..h4 left at 0) produces a configured-but-inconsistent obfuscation profile: the two ends can silently disagree on junk vs magic-header settings. P0 runs plain WireGuard (amnezia all-zero, unexercised), so this is latent. Belongs with the T19 amnezia end-to-end wiring. Severity low."
- severity: low
- suggestedFix: "In T19, add an Amnezia validation rule: when the block is configured, require the full obfuscation set to be internally consistent (and default magic headers to 1..4 when omitted rather than 0), so a partial config fails fast at load."

- headline: amneziawg-go stores amnezia message-type magic headers in package-level globals
- description: "Filed by the T8 implement-review panel (fable), file-and-defer. amneziawg-go v1.0.4 device.handlePostConfig assigns MessageInitiationType/MessageResponseType/MessageCookieReplyType/MessageTransportType — PACKAGE-LEVEL vars (noise-protocol.go:62-67) — on every configured IpcSet apply. Two Device instances in one process therefore cannot carry different obfuscation magic headers; the last apply wins process-wide. wanbond currently runs exactly one engine per process (one binary per role), so this is unexercised, but it constrains any future in-process multi-device usage (e.g. an in-process edge+concentrator test with distinct amnezia configs would silently share header types). Upstream dependency property, not fixable inside T8. Relevant to T19. Severity low."
- severity: low
- suggestedFix: "Before/at T19: document + assert the single-engine-per-process invariant in internal/device, or evaluate vendoring/patching the fork to move the message-type magic headers into per-Device state."
